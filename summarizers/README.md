# Compilation of Summarizers

Summarizers are designed to improve the efficiency of information consumption by extracting and presenting relevant content in a shortened form while retaining its original meaning.

Here, we have 4 summarizers projects.

They are mainly integrated with:


- Web Scraping: The script uses requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch the content of a given website. It strips out irrelevant elements like images and scripts to focus on the readable text.

- OpenAI API Integration/Ollama Integration: Once the website's content is scraped, the script sends the content to OpenAI's API for summarization. It formats the data into a prompt and asks the AI to summarize it, focusing on any relevant numeric data and making the explanation simple to understand (as if explaining to a 5-year-old).

- Markdown Output: The summary generated by OpenAI is then formatted in markdown for easy readability.

- Key Check: It checks if the API key for OpenAI is available and valid, ensuring the script works correctly.

# Website Summary

The website talks about a battle happening in a place called Kursk in Russia. Here are some important numbers to remember:

1. **38,000 soldiers**: This is how many Russian soldiers Ukraine claims have been lost in the fighting, with **15,000 of those being losses that cannot come back**.
2. **18 miles (30 km)**: This is how far Ukrainian troops advanced into Russian land during their operation that started in August.
3. **1,200 square kilometers**: This is the area of Russian territory that Ukrainian forces claimed to control at one point.
4. **93 villages**: This is how many villages Ukraine reported to have control over during the operation.

The fighting is still going on, and both sides are trying to claim victories. Ukraine is trying to keep Russian troops away from important areas. There are mentions of surprise attacks and different strategies being used by both sides.


2)  **[The project ](https://github.com/arielabade/llmEngineering/blob/main/summarizers/llmsAssistants/00summarizerOpenAI.py)** produces a personal virtual assistant to summarize content and explain it in a scientific tone with "how, what and why?" approaches. These are Ollama and Open AI outputs:

Explain to me how vector databases storage for AI works.

## Response
**Vector Database Storage for AI**
=====================================

**What is it?**
---------------

A vector database is a type of NoSQL database designed to efficiently store and query large vectors in high-dimensional spaces. These vectors represent data points, such as images, audio signals, or text documents, using dense representations that capture their semantic meaning.

**How was it created?**
----------------------

The concept of vector databases has its roots in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The idea of representing data as vectors emerged in the 1950s and 1960s with the development of linear algebra. However, it wasn't until the late 2010s that vector databases started to gain popularity.

The first vector database was proposed by [Xiaojuan Hu et al.] in 2016, which used a graph-based approach to store vectors in a sparse format. Since then, several other approaches have been developed, including:

* **Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah!)**: A library for efficient nearest neighbor search, introduced by [Sébastien Castells et al.] in 2016.
* **Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: An open-source library for efficient similarity search, developed by [Alexey Shvachko et al.] at Facebook AI.

**Practical Use**
------------------

Vector databases are particularly useful for applications that involve:

### **1. Similarity Search**

* **Image Retrieval**: Find similar images to a query image using techniques like nearest neighbor search.
* **Recommendation Systems**: Recommend products or content based on user behavior and preferences.

### **2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* **Text Classification**: Classify text documents into categories, such as spam vs. non-spam emails.
* **Information Retrieval**: Find relevant documents for a given search query.

### **3. Audio Processing**

* **Music Similarity Search**: Find similar music tracks to a query track based on audio features like melodies and rhythms.

**Example Code (Faiss)**
------------------------

Here's an example of how to use Faiss to store and query vectors:
```python
import faiss

# Generate some random vectors
import numpy as np
vectors = np.random.rand(100, 128)

# Create a Faiss index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(128)

# Add the vectors to the index
index.add(vectors)

# Query similar vectors
D, I = index.search(np.array([0.1 * v for v in vectors]), 5)
```
In this example, we generate some random vectors and add them to a Faiss index using the `IndexFlatL2` class. We then query similar vectors using the `search` method.

**Conclusion**
----------

Vector databases are an exciting new area of research that has the potential to revolutionize many applications in AI and beyond. By storing data as dense vectors, these databases can efficiently query similar data points and perform tasks like similarity search, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.




# OpenAI Output

### What It Is:

A **vector database** is a type of database optimized for storing, searching, and retrieving high-dimensional vectors. In the context of AI and machine learning, these vectors are often derived from the embeddings of data points, such as images, texts, or other datasets. An embedding is a numerical representation of an entity in a multi-dimensional space, enabling algorithms to capture the semantic meaning or similarities between the entities.

### How It Was Created:

1. **Understanding Vectors and Embeddings:**
   - **Vectors** are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. In AI, data often needs to be represented in a vector format to facilitate comparisons and calculations.
   - **Embeddings** are generated using machine learning models, such as neural networks, which convert raw data into vectors in a continuous vector space.

2. **Database Systems Evolution:**
   - Traditional relational databases (like SQL databases) are optimized for structured data and require fixed schemas, which is less efficient for handling high-dimensional vectors.
   - As AI gained prominence, the need arose for databases that facilitate efficient similarity search, clustering, and classification of vector data. This need led to the creation of vector databases.

3. **Indexing Techniques:**
   - Vector databases utilize advanced indexing techniques to enable fast querying. Common methods include:
     - **Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah):** A library that builds trees for efficient similarity searches.
     - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** An efficient clustering and similarity search library that supports high-dimensional vectors.
     - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs:** A graph-based method for approximate nearest neighbor search.

### Its Use:

1. **Applications in AI:**
   - **Recommendation Systems:** Vector databases enable quick retrieval of similar items based on user preferences or historical interaction.
   - **Image and Video Search:** Images can be embedded into high-dimensional vectors, allowing for efficient similarity searches based on visual content.
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text can be embedded into vector space using models like Word2Vec or BERT, enabling semantic search and document retrieval.

2. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - Vector databases are designed to handle large volumes of vector data efficiently. They provide optimized algorithms for querying similar vectors, which is crucial for applications requiring real-time performance.

3. **Integration with Machine Learning Pipelines:**
   - They can be integrated into larger machine learning workflows, allowing developers and data scientists to perform similarity searches as part of their applications, enabling functionalities like user-specific results and personalized experiences.

### Summary:

Vector databases are specialized systems for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors used in AI applications. They emerged due to the limitations of traditional databases in handling structured data representations required in ML tasks. With advanced indexing and optimization techniques, vector databases facilitate efficient retrieval of similar items, making them essential for various applications in recommendation systems, search engines, and natural language processing.
